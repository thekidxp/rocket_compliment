# rocket_compliment
First attempt at a emergency compliment app for rustbridge with a newer framework. Also here to compare Rocket to Actix-Web

## Proposed starting outline

- Shouldn't be too hard to start by talking about different ways to create routes and let people experiment with versions of hello world
- Move to showing static assets
- Using templating languages like handlebars
- Random data for the templates
- w/e else from there.
